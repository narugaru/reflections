I am using GIT which makes the commmand line alot like unix. 
And I can compare files using FC.
and cd and ls are commands I remember using back in college

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If you make a mistake , you can catch it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

logical changes saves files, and easier to compare.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

becuase they are dependent on each other. , while others are not.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log, gets you the commits.
git diff, gets you the differences. 
Watch the timeline carefully.
